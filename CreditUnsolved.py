# This might seem arcane, so let us have a look at that pattern. Anything inside parentheses is considered a group. So we have four groups: ([456][0-9]{3}) and three times ([0-9]{4}). The hyphens in between have ? and are therefore optional. If they exist, they must occur once, so -- is not allowed.
# 
# The [â€¦] indicates are character class. Only characters inside that class are allowed at that point. The ^ indicates that we're describing the start of our string, not some point in the middle. So we have to start with 456. That requriement is now met. We're followed by 3 ({3}) digits. Our first group therefore consists of four digits, and so do the others. The $ makes sure that there is nothing left: our string has to stop there.
# 
# The re documentation provides more information.
# 
# We now have met most of our conditions:
# 
# we have 16 digits
# we have groups of four
# we only have digits or hyphens
# we start with a 4, 5 or 6
